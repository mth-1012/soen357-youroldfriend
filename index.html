                    <h3><b><i>The problem</i></b></h3>
                    <p>With an increasing human lifespan, the aging population has been growing and with that comes a
                        need for technology that is catered to help the elderly. An important aspect that is relevant to
                        the elderly will be health. Ensuring good physical health and physical well-being is one of the
                        main priorities for elderly people. Furthermore, the restrictions resulting from the COVID-19
                        pandemic have further demonstrated the need for ways to ensure the physical well-being of the
                        elderly, such as keeping track of their medication due to complications from COVID-19 or
                        providing guiding exercises to maintain their physical well-being amidst social distancing
                        restrictions.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <span class="image"><img src="images/picElderly.PNG" alt=""/></span>
            </div>
            <p>Thanks to the prevalence of technologies such as smartphones, tablets or
                wearable technology, the elderly have also become more comfortable using such technologies in their
                regular lives. However, that does not mean that every app on the market is suitable for the
                elderly.</p>
            <p>Not only do such technology need to meet the needs of elderly people and provide functions that are
                useful to their daily lives, they also need to be adapted to suit their limitations and way of life to
                ensure better acceptance and effectiveness.</p>

                <div class="content">
                    <h3><b><i>Our solution</i></b></h3>
                    <p>Our app aims to help the elderly maintain physical well-being during the current pandemic by
                        tackling 2 problem areas: medication and exercise. Our app allows elderly users to input their
                        medication schedule and be reminded to take their medication according to that schedule.
                        Additionally, the app provides suitable exercise guiding videos for their age group and physical
                        abilities and for different forms of exercises that can be safely done at home. Elderly users
                        can also keep track of their progress.

                    <p>To ensure that our app is well-suited for the elderly demographic, some major components that
                        need to be examined in detail include:
                    <ul>
                        <li>The physical or cognitive limitations of the elderly</li>
                        <li>The usability goals of the elderly</li>

                    <p>To design an app that is well-suited to the needs of the elderly, we conducted a survey to know
                        more about the physical well-being of the elderly and how they manage in aspects such as
                        medication and exercise. People aged 50 and above were invited to respond to this survey.</p>

                    <p>Since similar apps can already be found in the current market, we have done some research to
                        identify their strengths and weaknesses, to design an app that incorporates some of these
                        strengths, while improving the weaknesses, and to better cater to the elderly users.</p>

                <h2>Design Process</h2>
            </header>

            <h3><b><i>User Flow</i></b></h3>
            <p>The diagram below shows how our app will function. The user goals helped us design an app that will
                satisfy our user.</p>
            <img src="images/userFlow.PNG" alt="User Flow" style="width: 80%"/>
            <br><br><br>

            <h3><b><i>Sketches</i></b></h3>
            <p>After completing the user flow, we started with a sketch of the basic design of our app,
                <br>in order to identify the basic layout and necessary pages.</p>
            <img src="images/sketches.PNG" alt="Sketches" style="width: 100%"/>
            <br><br><br>

            <h3><b><i>Wireframes</i></b></h3>
            <p>With the help of our sketches, we then formalized the design of our app using wireframes.</p>
            <img src="images/wireframes.PNG" alt="Wireframes" style="width: 100%"/>
            <br><br><br>

            <h3><b><i>Color Palette</i></b></h3>
            <p>During our research process, we found that we should avoid blue in our color palette when designing for
                the elderly. Thus, we have opted for a set of colors without blue and are soft yet eye-catching. This is
                so that while the elderly feel comfortable using the app, they are also engaged and can catch the
                necessary information presented to them in the app.</p>
            <a href="https://colorhunt.co/palette/98ddcad5ecc2ffd3b4ffaaa7"><img
                    src="https://colorhunt.co/image/98ddcad5ecc2ffd3b4ffaaa7" alt="Color Palette"
                    style="width: 70%; height: 200px"/></a>
            <br><br><br>

            <h3><b><i>Typography</i></b></h3>
            <p><b>Roboto</b> was chosen as the font for our app because it is a sans serif font, which is simple and
                easy
                to read. Hence, it is more suitable for the elderly, who may have poorer visual acuity or diminished
                eyesight. We have also chosen larger font sizes for the same reason.</p>

                <h2><b>FINAL DESIGN</b></h2>
            </header>

            <p>After going through the different stages of the design process, we have landed on the final design of our
                app.</p>

            <div class="major">
                <ul class="actions special">
                    <li><a href="https://xd.adobe.com/view/2c63aa9b-10f0-468a-8b6f-12cd6937302e-7930/" class="button">
                        Click here for our interactive design mockup with Adobe XD</a></li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <p>From our research, we found that a study was conducted to identify the barriers influencing the adoption
                of health apps for the older adults and their results found four categories of barriers: cognition,
                motivation, physical ability and perception. Physical ability, perceptual barriers and complexities of
                medical conditions, such as diminished eyesight related to diabetes or deteriorated motor skills as a
                result of rheumatism, can cause errors in user interaction. The elderly may also have a longer learning
                time.</p>
            <p>Thus, to cater to the elderly demographic, we have made foreground elements such as buttons and text a
                contrasting color from their background for an easier read. The size of the buttons have also been
                created to be larger than the size of a finger so that it is easy to tap. Interactions with the app have
                been kept relatively simple for greater learnability and memorability, with most of the interactions
                being button clicks and the rotation of the phone to watch videos full screen. The information on each
                page is kept short and clear so that elderly users will not be bombarded with too much information and
                will have an easier time focusing on the important information.</p>

            <div>
                <h3><b><i>Sign In & Register</i></b></h3>
                <p>The first page of the app is the sign in or register page. Their designs are similar to many other
                    apps
                    so that elderly users can make use of their existing knowledge and would not have to learn anything
                    new.</p>
                <img src="images/final/page1.PNG" alt="Sign In & Register" style="width: 100%"/>
            </div>

            <div style="margin-top: 40px">
                <h3><b><i>Home</i></b></h3>
                <p>After logging in, the user will be brought to the homepage. The homepage is kept simple and succinct
                    to indicate the 3 main sections: Medications, Exercises and Statistics, and does not provide any
                    irrelevant information for better clarity.</p>
                <img src="images/final/page2.PNG" alt="Homer" style="width: 33%"/>
            </div>

            <div style="margin-top: 40px">
                <h3><b><i>Medications</i></b></h3>
                <p>The Medications page provides a concise list of medication added by the user and allows the user to
                    input critical information including the time to take the medication and how often the medication
                    should be taken. Users can also upload a photo of their medication so that it will be easier for the
                    elderly to identify which medication they should take at that point based on shape and color,
                    instead of having to match the name of the medication to the medication itself.</p>
                <img src="images/final/page3.PNG" alt="Medications" style="width: 100%"/>
            </div>

            <div style="margin-top: 40px">
                <h3><b><i>Notifications</i></b></h3>
                <p>When a medication needs to be taken, the app will have a notification to indicate the name of the
                    medication, its photo, its dosage and time to be taken. The user will then have the option to
                    indicate if they have taken their medication or they have missed it. They can also opt to snooze the
                    reminder so that if they do not have the medication on hand, they will still be reminded again soon
                    to take it. This is helpful for elderly users who may have the tendency to forget to take their
                    medication if they do not have it with them at the point of the notification.</p>
                <img src="images/final/page4.PNG" alt="Notifications" style="width: 67%"/>
            </div>

            <div style="margin-top: 40px">
                <h3><b><i>Exercises</i></b></h3>
                <p>The Exercise page also provides a concise list of different types of exercises that are suitable for
                    people aged 50 and above. Choosing a specific form of exercise will bring the user to a page with a
                    guiding video and safety tips. This ensures that elderly users are performing these exercises
                    safely, especially since they are more prone to injuries if these exercises are not done
                    properly.</p>

            <div style="margin-top: 40px">
                <h3><b><i>Statistics</i></b></h3>
                <p>The Statistics page gives the users an overview of their progress. Based on our research, wearable
                    technologies are accepted by younger elderly, aged 55 to 70, so statistical information collected
                    from
                    their wearable technologies can also be displayed here.</p>

                <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                <p>This mini-project has allowed us to learn the importance of <b>understanding your users</b> and
                    <b>understanding the core problems</b>. Only then can your solution be targeted and catered to
                    specific users. We must admit, the process of
                    doing market research, conducting surveys and analyzing the users through journey maps and user
                    personas was really a great chance to study User Experience and User Interaction.
                    It has also made us realize how insufficient it was to simply classify all our
                    user base into one single ‘the elderly’ group.
                    <br><b>All in all, this has been a fruitful learning experience for our team.</b>
