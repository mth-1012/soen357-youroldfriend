                <p>To further understand the customers of our application, we have come up with some profiles to
                    represent
                    what we would call <i>our ideal users</i>, based on the researches conducted earlier.</p>

                <p>These personas that were created helps us find what our user is looking for in our app. There are two
                    main goals for this app.<br>
                <ul>
                    <li>The first one is to remind the user to take their medication on time.</li>
                    <li>The second one is to give them a lot of options for exercise when they do not know what exercise
                        to do.
                    </li>

                <h2 style="margin-top: 60px">Usability Goals</h2>
                <p>Here are some of the usability goals that we have identified for the elderly users</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <b>Effectiveness</b>: The app needs to allow the elderly to take their medication in a timely
                        manner and do physical activities to maintain physical well-being.
                    </li>
                    <li><b>Safety</b>: The app needs to ensure that the elderly safely consume the correct dosage of
                        medication and safely execute the exercises without the risk of physical injuries.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Learnability</b>: The app needs to be easy to learn to encourage greater user adoption,
                        especially since some elderly have the perception that technology is difficult to use.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Memorability</b>: The app will most likely be used daily so it needs to be easy for the user
                        to remember how it works.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                    and cognitively stimulating.</p>
